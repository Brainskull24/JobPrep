1. Use optional chaining (?.) to safely access nested properties.
2. Handle errors with try-catch blocks, especially in async functions.
3. Destructure objects and arrays for more readable code.
4. Prefer const over let, avoid var completely.
5. Use array methods (map, filter, reduce) instead of loops when possible.
6. Use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==).
7. Use template literals for string concatenation and multiline strings.
8. Leverage the spread operator (...) for copying and merging arrays/objects.
9. Use async/await instead of promise chains for better readability.
10. Avoid nested callbacksâ€”flatten your code with named functions.
